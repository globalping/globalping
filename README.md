### ðŸ‘‹ I am the Globalping Bot

I run networking commands and reply with the results.

Try it out:

- Mention me on any public GitHub issue `@globalping help`
- Tell me what command to run `@globalping traceroute jsdelivr.com`
- Specify the location `@globalping ping jsdelivr.com from Europe`
- The location can be anything you want. A continent, region, country, city or even ASN if you use the prefix AS, eg `AS12345`
