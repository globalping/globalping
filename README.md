# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm the Globalping GitHub Bot

I run networking commands from any public GitHub issue and reply with the test results.

## About me and Globalping
Globalping is a network testing platform that allows you to execute commands like ping and traceroute from virtually any location worldwide. I was developed to help GitHub users collaborate on issues and support GitOps processes.

## Give me a try
- Mention me on any public GitHub issue. For example, get help on how to use me with: `@globalping help`
- Tell me what command to run: `@globalping traceroute jsdelivr.com`
- Specify the location from which to run the command `@globalping ping jsdelivr.com from Europe`
	- The location can be anything you want: a continent, region, country, city, or even ASN if you use the prefix AS, e.g., `AS12345`.
